# [Java]
- Dependencies and plugins should refer version defined in the properties
- Use dependencyManagement to manage multiple dependencies for same project
- API endpoints should be versioned. Example v1/cars
- The event loop should never be blocked, if a blocking method needs to be executed use vertx.executeBlocking
- Avoid creating worker vertcles, use standard verticles instead
- All IO clients should be created in verticle and propagated to other classes using dependency injection
- Object Mapper should be created once and used across the application
- All clients should be closed in verticle stop method
- Use `this.` for instance variables and methods
- Code should follow controller, service, dao pattern
- Never use Single.fromFuture, Completable.fromFuture, Observable.fromFuture as these are blocking calls
- A single CI tool should be used for all workflows. Either github actions or jenkinsfile
